<body>
    <p> - It provides the set of properties and method that are used to manipulate the html document</p>

    <p>- Adding elements / Data</p>
    <p>- Removing elements / Data</p>
    <p>- Modifying elements / Data</p>
    <p>This document exposes the DOM [Document Object Model]</p>
    <p>Document object provides options used by developer to manipulate HTML document.</p>
    <p>DOM is hierachy of elements in document. [Root and Child Nodes]</p>
    <p>HTML elements that you use for presentation are defined as Nodes under DOM</p>

    <p>we can see</p>
    <p>types of nodes</p>

    <p>- Element Node - An element, as it existis in DOM. Button, radio, textbox.</p>
    <p>- Root Node - The top node in the tree. always html node. In the case of HTML it is "< html >"</p>
    <p>- Child - This is a node directyly inside another node. For ex: img is a child of figure __ parent node </p>
    <p>Decendent Node - a node anywhere inside another node. for ex: in body section we have figure and in figure we have  img</p>
    <p>Parent Node - a node which has another node inside. 
      body> is a parent Node
      body is not the root node. 
    </p>
    <p>sibling Nodes - Nodes that sit on the same level. in the DOM tree.

      ex: body open
          img  -- img is sibling of p
          p -- p is sibling of img 
           -- these two belong to the same level.
          body close
    </p>

    <p>text node - a node containing a text string. 
       
    </p>




     -- programming can use js to manipulate DOM.
     -- js allows the developer to access the nodes by using DOM hierarchy.
